### Welcome

Welcome to the webpage for the Open Redcedar Adaptation Network! Here you will find information, resources, data, and examples of analyses for you to explore.

You are welcome to participate in a small project to explore options for conserving western redcedar. The project was designed as an open demonstration where communities can participate in the stewardship, monitoring, and comparison of redcedar trees grown from two seed sources. 

Together we can study the climate adaptation potential of this important tree species to the Pacific Northwest. 

***

### Purpose

The purpose of this network is to provide opportunities for education about climate adaptation. Anyone is welcome to visit a planting site, measure trees to collect data, do some analyses, and share what they're learning!

### The Problem

Western redcedar is a important tree species in the Pacific Northwest, but it may need our help to stay healthy. Unfortunately, many redcedar trees have been observed dying recently and we're concerned about its survival in future climates. You can help accelerate research about the dieback by contributing to the [Western Redcedar Dieback Map](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/western-redcedar-dieback-map) project. These observations are valuable for understanding why redcedar is unhealthy, but the next step is to explore what we can do about it.  

*What can we do to help keep this species healthy?*

### Possible Solution

Together we can explore the genetic diversity of western redcedar as a tool for keeping trees healthy in a climate adaptation study. We can investigate if trees adapted to climates in Oregon will be better suited for upcoming climates in Washington.

***

### Study Approach

We've established a network of plantings with trees grown from populations in two seed zones. Trees from each zone are planted in alternating rows at each site.

* Trees from the following seed zones are planted at all sites.
  + Willamette Valley, Oregon
  + Lewis County, Washington

> **Are trees from Oregon better adapted to future climates in Washington?** 
You can help answer this question!


#### The Network

There are three plantings of western redcedar trees at three sites in western Washington.

+ Planting Locations
    + Discovery Park, Seattle (Planted February 8, 2022)
    + Swan Creek Park, Tacoma (Planted March 19, 2022)
    + Black River Riparian Forest, Renton (Planting Date May 7th or May 14th, 2022)

Each planting location has or will have trees from both seed zones planted in rows.

#### Openness

The data of this project are maintained openly so others can participate and learn from the study. If you collect data, please consider sharing it here so others can benefit. More instructions coming soon!





***  


### Preliminary Data {.tabset .tabset-fade}

Below you can explore some of the data available already. 

> Note the trees were not stored in a manner to compare tree heights or diameters in the first measurement. For example, before planting, we kept the trees separate to avoid accidentally mixing an Oregon tree with a Washington tree.

We plan to monitor the change in heights and diameters each year to compare between seed zones, sites, and annual climate variables.

#2023 seattle OR last row trees 42,43, 46 and 50 were missing. However, tree number 45 fit better with tree 46, feeling confident tree recorded as 45 was actually 46, and 47 was actually missing because trees 47-49 were actually trees 48-50, adjusted
#2023 Swan Creek WA #141 included a 40cm height increase, which must be a mistake. Recommend excluding all trees with greater than 30cm height increases from first analyses.

##### Site Plantings and Measurements

Summary coming soon.

```{r}
#create table summarizing when sites were planted and remeasured.
```


> Note the initial tree measuresments were collected on different days depending on the site (depending on when they would be planted). Therefore, comparisons between sites should be taken lightly. 

For example, trees at the Seattle site were remeasured 430 days after intial measurements, where trees at the Renton site were remeasured 342 days after initial measurement. Therefore, trees at Seattle are likely not growing faster, but rather, had larger time interval between measurements. 

##### Number of Trees

The below table lists the number of trees that were remeasured in 2024 at each site, excluding outliers. 

> Note, this table only includes trees that had positive height and diameter growth. For example, some trees were heavily browsed in 2024 and therefore may be shorter than trees in 2023. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Site.Summary <- trees.pos %>% group_by(Site,Seed.Zone,Measurement.Year) %>% summarize(n=n()) %>% left_join(.,trees.pos,by=c("Site","Seed.Zone","Measurement.Year"),multiple="first")

Site.Summary <- trees.wide.pos.all %>% group_by(Site,Seed.Zone) %>% summarize(n=n())
kable(Site.Summary[c(1,2,3)]) %>% kable_material(c("striped", "hover","condensed"))
```

##### Mean Height and Diameter Increase

The below table lists mean height and diameter increases between seed zones.  


```{r warning=FALSE}
trees.summary <- trees.wide.pos.all %>% group_by(Seed.Zone)  %>% summarize(
n=n(),
mean.height.2024=mean(Tree.Height..cm._2024),
mean.diameter.2024=mean(Tree.Diameter..mm._2024),
mean.y1.height.growth=mean(y1.height.growth,na.rm=TRUE),
mean.y1.diameter.growth=mean(y1.diameter.growth,na.rm=TRUE),
mean.y2.height.growth=mean(y2.height.growth,na.rm=TRUE),
mean.y2.diameter.growth=mean(y2.diameter.growth,na.rm=TRUE),
mean.total.height.growth=mean(total.height.growth,na.rm=TRUE),
mean.total.diameter.growth=mean(total.diameter.growth,na.rm=TRUE))

```

Trees from Oregon had a mean total height increase of `r round(trees.summary$mean.total.height.growth[trees.summary$Seed.Zone=="OR"],2)`cm and trees from Washington had a mean total height increase of `r round(trees.summary$mean.total.height.growth[trees.summary$Seed.Zone=="WA"],2)`cm.

##### Mean Increase by Site

The table below provides the same data, expect the means were calculated across seed zones and sites. 


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

n=n(),
mean.height.2024=mean(Tree.Height..cm._2024),
mean.diameter.2024=mean(Tree.Diameter..mm._2024),
mean.y1.height.growth=mean(y1.height.growth,na.rm=TRUE),
mean.y1.diameter.growth=mean(y1.diameter.growth,na.rm=TRUE),
mean.y2.height.growth=mean(y2.height.growth,na.rm=TRUE),
mean.y2.diameter.growth=mean(y2.diameter.growth,na.rm=TRUE),
mean.total.height.growth=mean(total.height.growth,na.rm=TRUE),
mean.total.diameter.growth=mean(total.diameter.growth,na.rm=TRUE))
